# cc65-contrib - Contributing
This repository is a collection of programs/projects made by users of cc65 and
as such is somewhat loosely connected to the main project. It is however much more
relaxed regarding what goes into the repository and how it should look like.

If you are just looking for the files go [back here](README.md).

---

## Requirements

If you want to contribute your program, please read the following few lines and
please adhere to these rules:

- Each project/program must live self contained in a seperate sub directory in
  the main tree of the repository.

- This subdirectory must contain a "Makefile" for GNU make, which provides
  these 3 standard targets:
  - default (no target given): build program, skip extra steps to eg build disk
    images of these require tools outside of cc65.
  - "all": build program, skip extra steps to eg build disk images of these
    require tools outside of cc65.
  - "clean": remove any files that were generated by this Makefile

- There should be no backslashes for path seperators used in source- or makefiles,
  use forward slashes instead. They will also work in windows :)

- Makefiles must not contain any shell specific things

## Nice to have

- a textfile named readme.txt that briefly describes the program, and how to build
it.

## making a pull request

- a pull request for a new project/program will:
    - add a subdirectory for the new project/program in the root of the repository
    - add that subdirectory to the Makefile in the root of the repository
    - update the list of programs in README.md
    - make sure the program compiles and works with the recent git head revision
      of the compiler/toolchain
