A small preview of what the new TGI functions can do.
Compiled using the cc65 head branch from 2009-11-12.
Do with the source whatever you want, but please note
that the vector font files are (C) Copyright Borland 
International (they're converted .CHR vector font 
files).

I will remove the package once the stuff becomes
mainstream.
