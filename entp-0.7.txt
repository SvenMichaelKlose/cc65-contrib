What is this thing for???

This is a little library for depacking Amica Paint and Zoomatic pictures.
It is designed for the C64, but it probably runs on other machines with vic.
The testprograms testamica and testzoom don't run on other machines than c64,
because i don't know the pokes to initialize gfx modes on non-c64's.

This Version is a little bit improved, as it doesn't bug when rle sequences 
overlap with two areas, for example screen and bitmap. Even the background color
bytes gets depacked for this reason. You can't be sure that it is the last byte of
the data, because it could be part of a rle sequence.

Planned is to put the two different depack modules into different files, so that they can
be linked separetedly. Further i plan a lib for initializing different c64 modes. The
procedures should return the adresses of the bitmap/screen/(colorram) area.
Further it should initialize valid combinations of them, only. There should be the
possibility to switch pages, if there is enough memory free. The gfx locations used
should depand on the memory model used. 
The problem is about the many pemutations of valid bitmap/screen/vicbank combinations
and that the program must get some information out of the config file.
Perhaps someone has ideas about that. Perhaps he/she would do it in a different way. 
Succestions are welcome.

The code is still very untidied. Will be fixed in unknown future.

The compiler version used was cc65-2.10.0.
