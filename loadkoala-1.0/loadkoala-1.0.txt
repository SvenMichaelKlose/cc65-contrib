cc65 koala viewer for the C64

Just a small example of how to load graphics into memory.
This program hereby put in the public domain, do whatever
you want with this source.

Compiled using cc65 version 2.8.0.

The Cyberwing title screen was drawn by TMR/Cosine who
graciously allowed me to include it as an example picture.
